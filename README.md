## Project Overview

The **Appliances Energy Prediction** project is designed to understand how various environmental factors, such as temperature, humidity, and outdoor weather conditions, impact energy consumption. The project follows a complete machine learning pipeline, including data preprocessing, exploration, model selection, training, and evaluation. The final model is used to predict energy usage and derive insights that could help optimize energy consumption in homes.

The key steps in the notebook include:
- **Data Preprocessing**
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- **Model Training and Hyperparameter Tuning**
- **Model Evaluation**
- **Insights and Conclusion**

## Dataset Description

The dataset consists of various environmental measurements from a household, which are used to predict the energy consumed by appliances. Key details about the dataset:

- **Features**: 
  - Indoor temperature and humidity
  - Outdoor weather conditions like pressure, wind speed, and visibility
  - Time-related features (time of day, day of the week)
  - Other environmental variables
- **Target Variable**: 
  - **Appliances Energy Consumption** (in Wh), which represents the total energy consumed by household appliances.

Data preprocessing steps include handling missing values, normalizing or scaling features, and performing feature selection or engineering as needed.

## Machine Learning Pipeline

The project follows a structured machine learning workflow:

### 1. Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing is an essential step in the pipeline, ensuring that the dataset is clean and ready for modeling. This involves:

- Handling missing or inconsistent data.
- Scaling the features to ensure uniformity.
- Selecting important features that are highly correlated with energy consumption.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA is performed to explore relationships between different features and the target variable (appliance energy consumption). Some key analyses include:

- Visualizing the distribution of energy consumption over time.
- Understanding correlations between indoor and outdoor conditions with energy usage.
- Analyzing trends and patterns using various visualizations like heatmaps, pair plots, and box plots.

### 3. Model Selection and Training

Multiple machine learning algorithms are evaluated to determine the best fit for the prediction task. The models considered include:

- **Linear Regression**
- **Random Forest Regressor**
- **Gradient Boosting Regressor**
- **Decision Tree Regressor**
- **XGBoost Regressor**

These models are trained using cross-validation techniques to ensure that the results are robust and generalizable.

### 4. Hyperparameter Tuning

Once the models are selected, hyperparameter tuning is performed to further optimize the performance of the selected models. This is done using techniques such as grid search or random search to find the best combination of model parameters.

### 5. Model Evaluation

The performance of each model is evaluated using standard regression metrics, which help assess prediction accuracy and error rates:

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Measures the average of the squared errors between predicted and actual values.
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: Provides a more interpretable error metric in the same units as the target variable.
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Calculates the average of absolute errors, providing an easy-to-understand evaluation of model accuracy.
- **R-squared (R²)**: Determines how well the model explains the variance in the target variable.

## Model Evaluation

The performance of each machine learning model is evaluated using several metrics:

- **MSE (Mean Squared Error)**: A lower value indicates that the model has fewer prediction errors.
- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**: Provides an easily interpretable measure of error in terms of energy consumption units.
- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**: The average difference between the predicted and actual values.
- **R² (R-squared)**: The closer this value is to 1, the better the model explains the variance in the target variable.

By comparing these metrics across different models, the best performing model is selected for energy consumption prediction.
