# Appliances-Energy-Prediction

1.Overview:
Experimental data used to create regression models of appliances energy use in a low energy building.

2. Objective:
The goal is to build a predictive model for appliance energy consumption using machine learning techniques, optimizing performance through hyperparameter tuning and evaluating results with appropriate metrics.

3. Data Description:
Source: The dataset contains features related to temperatures, humidity, and energy consumption (e.g., Appliances, lights, T_out, etc.).
Features: Numerical features related to environmental conditions, which are crucial for building a predictive energy model.

4. Data Collection:
[energydata_complete.csv](https://data.world/uci/appliances-energy-prediction)

5. Data Preprocessing and Cleaning:
Handle Missing Values: The dataset doesn't appear to have missing values.
Outliers: Detect and handle outliers, especially for features like Appliances, where high values may represent abnormal consumption patterns.
Skewed Data: Apply transformations (log or power transformations) to address skewness in features like Appliances and lights.

6. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Visualizations: Generate histograms, pair plots, and boxplots to explore relationships and distributions of key features (e.g., Appliances, temperatures).
Insights: Look for correlations between variables like temperature (T_out) and energy consumption.

7. Feature Engineering:
Encoding Categorical Variables: If there are any non-numerical columns (e.g., date), they can be encoded into useful features (e.g., extract hour, day, etc.).

8. Feature Selection:
Use algorithms like Random Forest to identify the most important features contributing to energy consumption.

9. Split Data into Training and Testing Sets:
Train-test split: Typically 80% training, 20% testing.

10. Feature Scaling:
Apply Standardization or Min-Max Scaling to ensure all features are on a uniform scale for models like SVR or neural networks.

11. Build the ML Model:
SVR
Random Forest Regressor
Gradient Boosting Regressor
Linear Regression
AdaBoost Regressor

12. Model Evaluation:
Used regression metrics like MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R² Score to evaluate model performance.

13. Hyperparameter Tuning:
Performed GridSearchCV to optimize model hyperparameters, improving performance.

14. Save the Model:
The models have been saved using joblib for future use, allowing easy reloading without retraining.

15. Test with Unseen Data:
Assessed the model’s performance on unseen data (either from a test set or a completely new dataset), ensuring it generalizes well.

16. Interpretation of Results (Conclusion):
In this step, you've analyzed the performance of the different models, concluding that Random Forest Regressor provide the best results, with some limitations regarding the dataset (e.g., lack of external factors like weather and occupancy).

17. Future Work:
Deep Learning: Implementing RNNs/LSTMs or deeper MLPs to capture temporal dependencies and potentially improve prediction accuracy.
Model Update: Implementing a system to periodically retrain the model with new data.
